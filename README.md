# BFS-in-a-directed-graph
The code is used to find ALL paths to EVERY leaf(termination) and to calculate probabilities on a directed graph.
Given a String to a starting node, the code will check all neighbors and then the neighbors's neighbors and so on, in a recursive way. 

I used Java as the programming language technology.
Running the code is very simple,
In the class "Search", there are two static Strings called "fileName" and "START" which represent the "starting" node and the "file name".
Changing those variables is all needed to run with different tests.
